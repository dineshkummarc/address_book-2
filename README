== Phonebook App - submission task for New Bamboo

Notes
-----

Initially I thought that Twitter API needed a password, for some reason... 
so I went and implemented safe storing of twitter passwords, encrypting with a salt.
This was not needed! 

You may search contacts by name (with autocomplete) or email address or twitter name (without).

The update_tweets rake task occasionally fails with 
#undefined method `stringify_keys' for #<String:0x22815ac>
however running it again seems to make it work.

Requires the Ruby Twitter Gem - had some trouble unpacking gems for this project
