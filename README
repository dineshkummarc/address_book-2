== Phonebook App - submission task for New Bamboo

Notes
-----

Initially I thought that Twitter API needed a password, for some reason... 
so I went and implemented safe storing of twitter passwords, encrypting with a salt.
This was not needed! 

You may search contacts by name (with autocomplete) or email address or twitter name (without).

"rake update_tweets" to get tweets for each contact with a twitter name. 

The Hobo plugin was used, giving user login functionality out of the box.
The default Hobo 'theme' was used, I replaced the site-wide search with the custom autocomplete contact search.
